				<p class="stext">Nugget Remastered is my remaster of my initial chicken nugget site. The original was very ugly and terribly coded and I incorrectly did the assignments for the whole unit on the site, so I had to remake the whole site. Without this mistake, Nugget Remastered would not exist today. Although it started off as a school project, I like to consider this more of a personal project because most of the later updates where in my own time.</p>
